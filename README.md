In this ML model,I had used three algorithms and have made three model using Logistic Regression,Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Method.

Contents included:-

1)Data Preprocessing
2)Training the model based on the three algorithms seperately in cells
3)Making predictions based on the train model,basically testing the trained dataset
4)Evaluating the Models using accuracy score,precision,recall score and f1 score
5)Confusion matrix of all the three models
7)Correlation matrix
8)Statistical analysis of the attributes in the dataset
